Radar-based precipitation forecasts and data from the German Weather Service (DWD).

Real-time location based precipitation analysis, forecasts, and historical accumulations — directly in Home Assistant.

## Features

- **RADVOR RS**: the past hour's total recomputed every 5 minutes, plus forecast totals for the next hour and the hour after
- **RADVOR RV** high-resolution nowcast, all derived from its 25-point 5-minute forecast series: peak-intensity forecasts in mm/h, *Precipitation start* / *end* timing sensors, and a *Precipitation expected* binary sensor
- **HymecNG** precipitation-*type* classification: an enum *Precipitation type* sensor telling rain from drizzle, snow, sleet, freezing rain/drizzle, graupel, and hail at your location
- Hourly and 24-hour precipitation accumulations from **RADOLAN RW/SF** (radar + weather station blend)
- Yesterday's 24-hour total updated once daily — ideal for irrigation or energy automations
- Per-location extraction: the nearest radar grid cell to your exact latitude/longitude
- Staleness guard: sensors can report `unavailable` when DWD data is stale, preventing automations from acting on outdated values
- Precise, quantitative analyses and predictions with high temporal and spatial resolution, enabling accurate tracking of rain events at your exact location
- Ideal data source for automations and early warnings of severe precipitation

## Configuration

### Setup

When adding the integration, you are prompted for:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A label for this integration instance (defaults to your HA location name) |
| **Location** | Latitude/longitude map picker — defaults to your HA home location |

### Options

After setup, open the integration's **Configure** dialog (**Settings > Devices & Services > DWD Precipitation > Configure**) to adjust:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Show sensor source metadata | Off | Adds per-sensor metadata attributes (see below) |
| Mark sensors unavailable when data is stale | On | Sensors become `unavailable` once cached data exceeds the product's release interval; prevents automations from acting on stale values |
| Precipitation detection threshold (mm per hour) | 0.0 | An RV forecast intensity above this value counts as precipitation for the `Precipitation start` / `Precipitation end` and `Precipitation expected` sensors. `0.0` means any DWD-detected rain; raise it to ignore drizzle/noise |
| Precipitation start/end sensor state | Absolute time | Whether the `Precipitation start`/`end` sensors report the absolute time (device class *timestamp*) or the minutes until the event (device class *duration*). The unused representation is exposed as an attribute |
| Precipitation end algorithm | First dry gap | How `Precipitation end` is derived from the forecast series. *First dry gap* ends the current rain episode at the first dry 5-minute window after it starts. *Precipitation clears within 2 h* looks past any lull to the last forecast precipitation, reporting when precipitation is gone for the rest of the horizon. They agree for a single uninterrupted episode and differ when rain arrives in separate waves |
| Precipitation reset threshold (mm) | 1.0 | `Precipitation now` at or above this value resets the `Timespan without precipitation` counter |

Some entities expose **companion attributes at all times** — these are a feature, not gated behind any option:

| Attribute | Entities | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `minutes_until` / `at` | `Precipitation start`, `Precipitation end`, `Precipitation expected` | The representation *not* shown as the state: `minutes_until` is the whole-minute countdown to the event, `at` its absolute ISO-8601 UTC time. On the start/end sensors, whichever the *Precipitation start/end sensor state* option does not select is exposed here; the binary sensor always carries both, pointing at the forecast start (`null` when no precipitation is expected) |
| `forecast_5min` | `Precipitation expected` | The full 25-point RV forecast series (leads 0–120 min in 5-minute steps); each point a dict of `lead`, `start`, `end`, `value` (mm) and `intensity` (mm/h). Excluded from recorder history to avoid bloat |
| `hours_without_precipitation` | `Timespan without precipitation` | The dry streak expressed in hours (the state itself is in days); `null` until the first anchor is set |
| `dry_since` | `Timespan without precipitation` | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the last precipitation that reset the counter |

When the **Show sensor source metadata** option is on, every DWD-product sensor additionally exposes its source metadata:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `source_product` | DWD internal product identifier read from the file header (e.g. `"RADVOR-RS"`, `"RW"`) |
| `source_timestamp` | UTC ISO-8601 reference time of the DWD product — for RADVOR forecasts this is the analysis time before the lead offset; for RADOLAN products it is the end of the measurement window |
| `lead_time_minutes` | Forecast lead time in minutes (`0` for the nowcast, `60` or `120` for RADVOR forecasts, `null` for RADOLAN products which have no lead time) |
| `data_start` | ISO-8601 UTC start of the accumulation window (e.g. T−60 min for "last hour"); `null` for products without an accumulation window |
| `data_end` | ISO-8601 UTC end of the accumulation window; for RADOLAN products this equals `source_timestamp` |

## Entities

All sensors belong to a single **DWD Precipitation** device per configured location.

### Reading the names

Most entities state their own time window:

- **`last <N>`** — *measured*, accumulated over the **N hours ending now**. `Precipitation last 24h` is the rain that fell since this time yesterday.
- **`next <N>`** — *forecast*, covering the **N hours starting now**. `Precipitation next 1h` is the total expected over the coming 60 minutes.
- **`next 1–2h`** — the two numbers are the window's **start and end**, counted in hours from now. So this is the *second* hour ahead — from 60 to 120 minutes — and it **excludes** the coming hour. Add `Precipitation next 1h` and `Precipitation next 1–2h` together for the full two-hour total.

The remaining entities are named for the question they answer rather than for a
window. Their time spans are:

| Entity | Time span |
|--------|-----------|
| `Precipitation now` | The **past 60 minutes**. Millimetres accumulated over the last hour, *not* a mm/h rate — the same period as `Precipitation last 1h`, but recomputed every 5 minutes instead of once an hour |
| `Precipitation type` | **This moment.** The only genuinely instantaneous value in the integration — what is falling right now, if anything |
| `Precipitation start` / `Precipitation end` | Searched over the **next 2 hours**. Beyond that horizon the sensor reports `unknown`, so an `unknown` end means "still raining 2 hours from now", not "never" |
| `Precipitation expected` | Also the **next 2 hours**. `off` means "no precipitation forecast within 2 hours" |
| `Timespan without precipitation` | Open-ended — counts up from the last time `Precipitation now` reached the reset threshold |

### Sensors

| Entity | Data source | Unit | Update interval | Description |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `Precipitation now` | RADVOR RS | mm | 5 min | Radar-only total for the past hour, recomputed every 5 minutes — the live counterpart to `Precipitation last 1h`. Use it when you want the value to respond promptly |
| `Precipitation last 1h` | RADOLAN RW | mm | 1 h | The same 60-minute window, radar + rain-gauge blended. Arrives once an hour, but is the more accurate of the two |
| `Precipitation last 24h` | RADOLAN SF | mm | 1 h | Radar + station-blended total for the rolling past 24 hours |
| `Precipitation yesterday` | RADOLAN SF | mm | Daily (~00:18 UTC+1) | Previous calendar day's 24-hour accumulated total |
| `Precipitation type` | HymecNG | enum | 5 min | What is falling at the location **at this moment** — one of `no_precipitation`, `not_classified`, `drizzle`, `rain`, `freezing_drizzle`, `freezing_rain`, `sleet`, `snow`, `graupel`, `hail`, `large_hail` (`unknown` outside radar coverage) |
| `Precipitation next 1h` | RADVOR RS | mm | 5 min | Calibrated radar forecast total for the **next 0–60 minutes** |
| `Precipitation next 1–2h` | RADVOR RS | mm | 5 min | Calibrated radar forecast total for the **60–120 minute** window — the hour *after* the one above, not the two-hour total |
| `Peak intensity next 1h` | RADVOR RV | mm/h | 5 min | Heaviest rain rate expected in the **next 0–60 minutes** — the wettest 5-minute step extrapolated to an hourly rate. Use it to tell drizzle from a downpour; `Precipitation next 1h` tells you the volume |
| `Peak intensity next 1–2h` | RADVOR RV | mm/h | 5 min | Same, for the **60–120 minute** window |
| `Precipitation start` | RADVOR RV | timestamp / min | 5 min | When precipitation begins at the location within the next 2 hours (`0` / now if already raining, `unknown` if none within 2 h). Reports the absolute time or the minutes-until value per the *start/end sensor state* option; the other form is the `minutes_until` / `at` attribute |
| `Precipitation end` | RADVOR RV | timestamp / min | 5 min | When precipitation ends (`unknown` if it continues beyond the 2 h horizon). The *Precipitation end algorithm* option chooses between ending at the first dry gap or when rain clears for the rest of the horizon. Same representation option as `Precipitation start` |
| `Precipitation expected` | RADVOR RV | on / off | 5 min | `on` when precipitation is forecast within the next 2 hours. Exposes the forecast start time as `minutes_until` / `at` attributes so an automation can trigger on it and read the start time directly, and carries the full RV forecast curve in `forecast_5min` (excluded from recorder history) |
| `Timespan without precipitation` | RADVOR RS | days | 5 min | Time since `Precipitation now` last reached the rain reset threshold; exposes `hours_without_precipitation` and `dry_since` attributes. Persists across restarts and is corrected on startup against the RW/SF totals for rain during downtime |

## Troubleshooting

**Sensors show `unavailable` immediately after setup** — the integration fetches data on startup; if DWD OpenData is temporarily unreachable the first refresh fails. Check your HA logs for HTTP errors and verify that `opendata.dwd.de` is reachable from your network.

**Sensors always show `unavailable`** — confirm that your configured coordinates are within Germany. Coordinates outside the radar composite coverage area produce a `NaN` from the grid lookup, which surfaces as `unavailable`.

**`extra_state_attributes` are not appearing** — enable the option in **Settings > Devices & Services > DWD Precipitation > Configure**.

**Old values persist after a DWD outage** — if *Mark sensors unavailable when data is stale* is disabled, the last cached value is kept indefinitely. Enable the option so that sensors go `unavailable` once the staleness window expires.
